"""X / Twitter feed control surface.

Verified against com.twitter.android 12.21.1-prod.05 on RMX3395, 2026-09-02.
See ../../../feed-former.md for the control inventory this implements.

Two facts drive the whole design:

1. **X's post-options menu is surface-dependent.** `Not interested in Post` is
   present on the For-you tab and ABSENT on a List/Topic tab, because Lists and
   Topics are reverse-chronological pipelines with no ranker to signal. A blind
   index tap on the wrong tab lands on `Follow @handle` - the opposite of the
   intended signal. Every mutation here therefore matches on the item's LABEL
   and refuses when the label is missing. It never taps by position.

2. **The active-tab flag is invisible to `ui.parse`.** The node carrying
   `selected="true"` is an anonymous `android.view.View`: no text, no
   resource-id, not clickable, so `ui.parse`'s `meaningful` test drops it. This
   module reads the raw XML for that one signal. Without it there is no way to
   know which timeline is live, and without that, rule 1 cannot be enforced.

Every state-changing call is two-phase: it returns a `plan` describing the exact
tap it would make, and only performs it when `apply=True`. Applied changes are
appended to `artifacts/feed/journal.jsonl` so a session's edits to a real
account are auditable and reversible after the fact.

    1. **They cannot coexist.** `uiautomator2` IS a UiAutomation, which is a
       special AccessibilityService, and Android permits exactly one. Reading
       through u2 (feed/read.py) while acting through shell `uiautomator dump`
       kills one of them - observed as the dump exiting 137 (SIGKILL) mid-run.
       The README warned about this for the phase-1/phase-2 backends; it applies
       just as much to two paths inside one process.
    2. **u2 is 12x faster** - 0.21 s against 2.47 s for shell dump + cat,
       measured on this device over USB - and it returns the full tree where the
       shell dump returns a compressed one (~25 KB vs ~8 KB).
