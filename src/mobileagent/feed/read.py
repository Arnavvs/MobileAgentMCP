"""Real-time feed reading: what is on screen right now, as structured posts.

Built because every feed-shaping decision needs to be made against what is
actually visible - "is this post football or politics" cannot be answered from a
tap coordinate. The agent needs to read before it acts, at a rate that keeps up
with scrolling.

The enabling measurement (RMX3395, USB, 2026-09-03):

    shell `uiautomator dump` + `cat`   2.47 s per read
    uiautomator2 `dump_hierarchy()`    0.21 s per read      <- 12x faster

So this module holds ONE persistent `uiautomator2` connection and reuses it,
rather than shelling out per read. 0.21 s is roughly five reads a second, which
is fast enough to read a feed while scrolling it. `feed/x.py` still uses the
shell path for control actions, where a 2 s cost is irrelevant next to the
settle time after a tap.

A second reason to prefer u2 here: the shell dump returns a COMPRESSED tree
(~8 KB for a screen where u2 returns ~25 KB), so it drops nodes. More tree is
strictly better for reading.

Nothing in this module writes to the device. It is the instrument, not the
treatment.
