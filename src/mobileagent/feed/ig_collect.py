"""Collect what Instagram is actually serving, without changing anything.

Read-only by construction: it opens each reel's More sheet to read Meta's
AI-generated description, then closes it with BACK. It never taps a sheet row -
Interested, Not interested, Save and Report all write to the account.

Each reel is recorded with its public permalink, read from Instagram's own
logcat line as the video is swapped in (see `ig_links` for how, and for the
clipboard dead end it replaces). The link costs no taps and no extra seconds -
only a `logcat` reader running alongside the pass. Where it fails it says so:
`url` is None and `url_note` says why, rather than a missing key that reads
like a reel with no link.

Because the id is logged on the swipe ONTO a reel, the reel already on screen
when a pass starts has none. The pass therefore advances one reel before
recording anything, so that all `n` rows carry a link; `prime=False` keeps that
first reel at the cost of a row without one.
