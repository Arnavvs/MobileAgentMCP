"""Instagram feed control: read a reel's meaning, then tell the ranker.

Verified against com.instagram.android 440.1.0.46.86 on RMX3395, 2026-09-03.

Instagram is the richest of the three surfaces, and the only one where a
controlled experiment is possible - it has BOTH a per-item signal (Interested /
Not interested) AND a global reset (Reset suggested content). X has neither.

The thing that makes it work, though, is a piece of luck: **Meta hands over its
own content understanding, as text.** A reel carries no caption in the
accessibility tree - just counts - so there is nothing for a text model to read.
But the reel's More sheet contains an AI-generated description:

    "A young woman humorously captures India's middle-class budget struggles,
     where even spending 50 rupees feels like a major financial decision..."

Scored against that with the on-device embedder (`feed.read`):

    indian middle class comedy relatable humour   0.334
    personal finance money saving                 0.290
    football match                                0.140
    bollywood film celebrity gossip               0.098

So video needs no video model here. Meta has already watched the reel and
written down what it is about; we read the sentence. A frame-sampling CLIP model
would cost orders of magnitude more to reach a worse description of the same
thing. The description is not always present - older reels often lack it, and it
is sometimes vague - so `about_reel` says which case it hit rather than
returning an empty string that reads like an opinion.

Everything that writes is two-phase (`apply=False` plans) and journalled, as in
`feed.x`.

    """Open the reel's More sheet and read Meta's description from under its heading.

    The More control's touch target is unreliable - a single tap often does
    nothing - so opening retries rather than reporting a reel as having no
    description when the sheet never opened. Those two failures look identical
    from the outside and must not be confused.

    Finding the description used to mean taking the longest unnamed text node in
    the sheet, and that was wrong in a way that did not look wrong. The sheet
    also carries the audio credit ("Salim-Sulaiman, Sukhwinder Singh - Haule
    Haule") and the reel's caption, both unnamed and both long enough to pass a
    length test. The description generates a beat AFTER the sheet renders, so
    for that beat the longest node is the music, and a reader that returns the
    first candidate it sees returns the music. A 20-reel pass recorded 7 track
    listings as descriptions and reported them as a 95% success rate.

    So the anchor is the heading, not the length. "About this reel" is a node of
    its own and the description is the text node after it; until that text
    exists there is no description, however much other text the sheet holds.

    Waiting is split in two, because the two absences are different. A sheet
    that shows no heading within `header_grace` has no description section at
    all and never will - that is an older reel, and waiting longer only costs
    time. A heading whose body has not filled in is still generating, and gets
    the full `wait_s`.
