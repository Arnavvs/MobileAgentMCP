"""MCP surface for X feed control.

Thin registration only - the logic lives in `mobileagent.feed.x` so the CLI in
`tools/xfeed.py` and the server run exactly the same code paths.

Mutating tools default to `apply=False` and return the tap they *would* make.
That is deliberate: these act on a real account, and an agent that has to ask
twice cannot fire one by accident on the first.
